  abstract =     "This paper describes a file system structure for
                 supporting Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. The
                 device driver model clearly separates control- and
                 datapath operations and presents a low-level of
                 abstraction. The data-path module provides translation
                 and protection of I/O requests enabling the file system
                 layers to be executed as unprivileged code within
                 shared libraries. Scheduling of low-level operations
                 within the device driver is used to provide isolation
                 between clients and Quality of Service guarantees.",
